## Introduction
The Recipe App is an application that allows users to search, filter, view, and favorite both meal and drink recipes. The project was developed by a group of 5 students as part of our learning experience. It is mobile-only and runs in the web browser. This application relies on two third-party APIs to fetch all the recipes, one for meals and another for drinks. It is built using React (JavaScript), SCSS for styling, localStorage for data persistence and React hooks for sharing it among components.
